**worldmap** is an J2ME OpenStreetMap client using online OSM data.

=== Usage ===

* Use the 4-way-buttons (or '2', '8', '4' and '6') to move around on the map.
* Use '5' (or Enter on some phones) to zoom in and '0' to zoom out.
* Press '1' to center the map on the current GPS position (if it is available).

=== Requirements ===

* CLDC 1.1 (JSR 139)
* MIDP 2.0 (JSR 118)
* Java API for Bluetooth (JSR-82)  (optional for external GPS receiver)
* Java Location API (JSR-179) (optional)

Hardware reference phones are the Nokia 6300i and the Sony Ericsson K610i. Others will probably work. Some sort of traffic flatrate is highly recommended as the app uses online maps.

=== Paper ===

There is a paper of the creation of version 1.0 of this application, see [[https://bitbucket.org/cli/wandersmann/downloads/mobiler_osm_j2me_client.pdf|here]] (german).
